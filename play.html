    All's Well That Ends Well

<h3>
    Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
</h3>



<p>Enter COUNTESS and Clown</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
that he comes not along with her.</p>

<h6>Clown</h6>
<p>By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
melancholy man.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>By what observance, I pray you?</p>

<h6>Clown</h6>
<p>Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
Opening a letter</p>

<h6>Clown</h6>
<p>I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>What have we here?</p>

<h6>Clown</h6>
<p>E'en that you have there.</p>

<p>Exit</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>[Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'
eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
before the report come. If there be breadth enough
in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
to you. Your unfortunate son,
BERTRAM.
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
To fly the favours of so good a king;
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire.
Re-enter Clown</p>

<h6>Clown</h6>
<p>O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
soldiers and my young lady!</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>What is the matter?</p>

<h6>Clown</h6>
<p>Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
thought he would.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Why should he be killed?</p>

<h6>Clown</h6>
<p>So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
men, though it be the getting of children. Here
they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
hear your son was run away.</p>

<p>Exit</p>

<p>Enter HELENA, and two Gentlemen</p>

<h6>First Gentleman</h6>
<p>Save you, good madam.</p>

<h6>HELENA</h6>
<p>Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.</p>

<h6>Second Gentleman</h6>
<p>Do not say so.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
That the first face of neither, on the start,
Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?</p>

<h6>Second Gentleman</h6>
<p>Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
Thither we bend again.</p>

<h6>HELENA</h6>
<p>Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.
Reads When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
of thy body that I am father to, then call me
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
This is a dreadful sentence.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Brought you this letter, gentlemen?</p>

<h6>First Gentleman</h6>
<p>Ay, madam;
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
But I do wash his name out of my blood,
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?</p>

<h6>Second Gentleman</h6>
<p>Ay, madam.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>And to be a soldier?</p>

<h6>Second Gentleman</h6>
<p>Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
The duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Return you thither?
First Gentleman
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.</p>

<h6>HELENA</h6>
<p>[Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
'Tis bitter.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Find you that there?</p>

<h6>HELENA</h6>
<p>Ay, madam.</p>

<h6>First Gentleman</h6>
<p>'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
heart was not consenting to.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
There's nothing here that is too good for him
But only she; and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?</p>

<h6>First Gentleman</h6>
<p>A servant only, and a gentleman
Which I have sometime known.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Parolles, was it not?</p>

<h6>First Gentleman</h6>
<p>Ay, my good lady, he.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
With his inducement.
First Gentleman
Indeed, good lady,
The fellow has a deal of that too much,
Which holds him much to have.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>You're welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son,
To tell him that his sword can never win
The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
Written to bear along.</p>

<h6>Second Gentleman</h6>
<p>We serve you, madam,
In that and all your worthiest affairs.</p>

<h6>COUNTESS</h6>
<p>Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
Will you draw near!
Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen</p>

<h6>HELENA</h6>
<p>'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
That chase thee from thy country and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
Whoever charges on his forward breast,
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
His death was so effected: better 'twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
My being here it is that holds thee hence:
Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although
The air of paradise did fan the house
And angels officed all: I will be gone,
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.</p>

<p>Exit</p>
